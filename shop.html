              <p> Following along the same lines as its predecessor (Agricola), Caverna: The Cave Farmers is a
                worker-placement game at heart, with a focus on farming. In the game, you are the bearded leader of a
                small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and
                his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each
                turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You
                furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.</p>
              <p>It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on
                expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across
                water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your
                cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow
                fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your
                ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.</p>
              <p>You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different
                furnishing tiles for your cave.</p>
              <p>Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete
                redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while
                adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources.
                Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially
                the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also
                includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.</p>

              <p>A Feast for Odin is a saga in the form of a board game. You are reliving the cultural achievements,
                mercantile expeditions, and pillages of those tribes we know as Viking today — a term that was used
                quite differently towards the end of the first millennium.</p>
              <p>When the northerners went out for a raid, they used to say they headed out for a viking. Their
                Scandinavian ancestors, however, were much more than just pirates. They were explorers and founders of
                states. Leif Eriksson is said to be the first European in America, long before Columbus.</p>
              <p>In what is known today as Normandy, the intruders were not called Vikings but Normans. One of them is
                the famous William the Conqueror who invaded England in 1066. He managed to do what the king of Norway
                failed to do only a few years prior: conquer the Throne of England. The reason why the people of these
                times became such strong seafarers is due to their unfortunate agricultural situation. Crop shortfalls
                caused great distress.</p>
              <p>In this game, you will raid and explore new territories. You will also experience their day-to-day
                activities: collecting goods to achieve a financially secure position in society. In the end, the player
                whose possessions bear the greatest value will be declared the winner.</p>

              <p>In the land of Terra Mystica dwell 14 different peoples in seven landscapes, and each group is bound to
                its own home environment, so to develop and grow, they must terraform neighboring landscapes into their
                home environments in competition with the other groups.</p>
              <p>Terra Mystica is a full information game without any luck that rewards strategic planning. Each player
                governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as great an area
                as possible and to develop that group's skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can
                progress. To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities.</p>
              <p>Taking turns, the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different
                buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses
                allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group's special ability, and temples allow you to
                develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be
                developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple
                can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill
                with boats to use the rivers. The groups in question, along with their home landscape, are:
              <ul class="font-weight-bold">
                <li> Desert (Fakirs, Nomads)</li>
                <li> Plains (Halflings, Cultists)</li>
                <li> Swamp (Alchemists, Darklings)</li>
                <li>Lake (Mermaids, Swarmlings)</li>
                <li> Forest (Witches, Auren)</li>

                <li>Wasteland (Giants, Chaos Magicians)</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>Proximity to other groups is a double-edged sword in Terra Mystica. Being close to other groups gives
                you extra power, but it also means that expanding is more difficultgame</p>

              <p class="font-weight-bold">Age: 12+</p>
              <p>The game is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an
                aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and
                powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of
                travelers.</p>
              <p>The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their
                princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile
                is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its
                own type of settlement tile.</p>
              <p>The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds. Each phase begins with the game
                board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles. At the beginning of each round all players roll
                their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die. A goods
                tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die. During each round
                players take their turns in the current turn order. During his turn, a player may perform any two of the
                four possible types of actions:
              <ul>
                <li> 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his
                  dice and place it in the staging area on his player board.</li>
                <li> 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board
                  with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent
                  to a previously placed settlement tile.</li>
                <li>3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice.</li>
                <li>4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice. In addition to these
                  actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in
                  the staging area on his player board. If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points
                  are immediately recorded.</li>
              </ul> Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn
              order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points. Bonus victory points are awarded for
              filling a region with settlement tiles.</p>
              <p>The game ends when the last player finishes his turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase. Victory
                points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods. Bonus victory points from
                certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.</p>
              <p>The player with the most victory points wins.</p>

              <p>Brass: Birmingham is an economic strategy game sequel to Martin Wallace' 2007 masterpiece, Brass.
                Birmingham tells the story of competing entrepreneurs in Birmingham during the industrial revolution,
                between the years of 1770-1870.</p>
              <p>As in its predecessor, you must develop, build, and establish your industries and network, in an effort
                to exploit low or high market demands.</p>
              <p>Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any
                of the following actions (found in the original game):
              <ul>
                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Build</span> - Pay required resources and place an industry tile.
                </li>
                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Network</span> - Add a rail / canal link, expanding your network.
                </li>
                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Develop</span> - Increase the VP value of an industry.</li>
                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Sell</span> - Sell your cotton, manufactured goods and pottery.</li>
                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Loan </span>- Take a £30 loan and reduce your income.</li>
                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Scout</span> - Discard three cards and take a wild location and wild
                  industry card. (This action replaces Double Action Build in original Brass.)</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>The game is played over two halves: the canal era (years 1770-1830) and the rail era (years 1830-1870).
                To win the game, score the most VPs. VPs are counted at the end of each half for the canals, rails and
                established (flipped) industry tiles.</p>
              <p>Birmingham features dynamic scoring canals/rails. Instead of each flipped industry tile giving a static
                1 VP to all connected canals and rails, many industries give 0 or even 2 VPs. This provides players with
                the opportunity to score much higher value canals in the first era, and creates interesting strategy
                with industry placement.</p>
              <p class="font-weight-bold">New "Sell" system</p>
              <p>Brewing has become a fundamental part of the culture in Birmingham. You must now sell your product
                through traders located around the edges of the board. Each of these traders is looking for a specific
                type of good each game. To sell cotton, pottery, or manufactured goods to these traders, you must also
                "grease the wheels of industry" by consuming beer. For example, a level 1 cotton mill requires one beer
                to flip. As an incentive to sell early, the first player to sell to a trader receives free beer.</p>
              <p>Birmingham features three all-new industry types:
              <ul>
                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Brewery</span> - Produces precious beer barrels required to sell
                  goods.</li>
                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Manufactured goods</span> - Function like cotton, but features eight
                  levels. Each level of manufactured goods provides unique rewards, rather than just escalating in VPs,
                  making it a more versatile (yet potentially more difficult) path vs cotton.</li>
                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Pottery</span> - These behemoths of Birmingham offer huge VPs, but at
                  a huge cost and need to plan.</li>
                <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Increased Coal and Iron Market size</span> - The price of coal and
                  iron can now go up to £8 per cube, and it's not uncommon.</li>
              </ul>

                airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the
                Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very
                outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to
                sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll
                need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your
                reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.</p>
              <p>Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star
                Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star
                Wars game before it.</p>
              <p>Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as
                your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the
                individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor
                Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and
                the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy.
                You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that
                freezes Han Solo in carbonite!</p>

              <p class="font-weight-bold">Number of players: 1-5</p>
              <p class="font-weight-bold">Playing time: 120 Min</p>
              <p class="font-weight-bold">Age: 12+</p>
              <p>In the 2400s, mankind begins to terraform the planet Mars. Giant corporations, sponsored by the World
                Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean
                coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations
                and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded
                not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure
                throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.</p>
              <p>The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their
                hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling
                asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse
                gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as
                increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become
                playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so
                there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can
                cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always
                available to complement your cards.</p>
              <p>Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20),
                which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is
                complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.</p>
              <p>Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six
                types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you
                compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for
                different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and
                consists of the following phases:
              <ul>
                <li>1) Player order shifts clockwise.</li>
                <li>2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.</li>
                <li>3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a
                  Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and
                  raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The
                  turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.</li>
                <li>4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production
                  parameters.</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the
                terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation. Count your Terraform Rating and other
                VPs to determine the winning corporation!</p>

              <p class="font-weight-bold">Age: 13+</p>
              <p>In the most distant reaches of the world, magic still exists, embodied by spirits of the land, of the
                sky, and of every natural thing. As the great powers of Europe stretch their colonial empires further
                and further, they will inevitably lay claim to a place where spirits still hold power - and when they
                do, the land itself will fight back alongside the islanders who live there.</p>
              <p>Spirit Island is a complex and thematic cooperative game about defending your island home from
                colonizing Invaders. Players are different spirits of the land, each with its own unique elemental
                powers. Every turn, players simultaneously choose which of their power cards to play, paying energy to
                do so. Using combinations of power cards that match a spirit's elemental affinities can grant free bonus
                effects. Faster powers take effect immediately, before the Invaders spread and ravage, but other magics
                are slower, requiring forethought and planning to use effectively. In the Spirit phase, spirits gain
                energy, and choose how / whether to Grow: to reclaim used power cards, to seek for new power, or to
                spread presence into new areas of the island.</p>
              <p>The Invaders expand across the island map in a semi-predictable fashion. Each turn they explore into
                some lands (portions of the island); the next turn, they build in those lands, forming settlements and
                cities. The turn after that, they ravage there, bringing blight to the land and attacking any native
                islanders present.</p>
              <p>The islanders fight back against the Invaders when attacked, and lend the spirits some other aid, but
                may not always do so exactly as you'd hoped. Some Powers work through the islanders, helping them (eg)
                drive out the Invaders or clean the land of blight.</p>
              <p>The game escalates as it progresses: spirits spread their presence to new parts of the island and seek
                out new and more potent powers, while the Invaders step up their colonization efforts. Each turn
                represents 1-3 years of alternate-history.</p>
              <p>At game start, winning requires destroying every last settlement and city on the board - but as you
                frighten the Invaders more and more, victory becomes easier: they'll run away even if some number of
                settlements or cities remain. Defeat comes if any spirit is destroyed, if the island is overrun by
                blight, or if the Invader deck is depleted before achieving victory.</p>
              <p>The game includes different adversaries to fight against (eg: a Swedish Mining Colony, or a Remote
                British Colony). Each changes play in different ways, and offers a different path of difficulty boosts
                to keep the game challenging as you gain skill.</p>

              <p>Gloomhaven is a game of Euro-inspired tactical combat in a persistent world of shifting motives.
                Players will take on the role of a wandering adventurer with their own special set of skills and their
                own reasons for traveling to this dark corner of the world. Players must work together out of necessity
                to clear out menacing dungeons and forgotten ruins. In the process, they will enhance their abilities
                with experience and loot, discover new locations to explore and plunder, and expand an ever-branching
                story fueled by the decisions they make.</p>
              <p>This is a game with a persistent and changing world that is ideally played over many game sessions.
                After a scenario, players will make decisions on what to do, which will determine how the story
                continues, kind of like a “Choose Your Own Adventure” book. Playing through a scenario is a cooperative
                affair where players will fight against automated monsters using an innovative card system to determine
                the order of play and what a player does on their turn.</p>
              <p>Each turn, a player chooses two cards to play out of their hand. The number on the top card determines
                their initiative for the round. Each card also has a top and bottom power, and when it is a player’s
                turn in the initiative order, they determine whether to use the top power of one card and the bottom
                power of the other, or vice-versa. Players must be careful, though, because over time they will
                permanently lose cards from their hands. If they take too long to clear a dungeon, they may end up
                exhausted and be forced to retreat.</p>

              <p>Exploding Kittens is a kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette. Players take turns drawing cards
                until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you
                avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or
                shuffling the deck.</p>
              <p>The game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means
                a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.</p>

              <p>Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24
                sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very
                similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to
                travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues
                before they get out of hand.</p>
              <p>During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the
                world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations,
                treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease
                has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards
                of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with
                special abilities to help them at these actions.</p>
              <p>After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards,
                which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes
                even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive
                to travel to.</p>
              <p>Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you
                win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding
                for beneficial event cards.</p>
              <p>During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to
                permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and
                placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A
                character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.</p>

              <p>Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition) is a game of galactic conquest in which three to six players take on
                the role of one of seventeen factions vying for galactic domination through military might, political
                maneuvering, and economic bargaining. Every faction offers a completely different play experience, from
                the wormhole-hopping Ghosts of Creuss to the Emirates of Hacan, masters of trade and economics. These
                seventeen races are offered many paths to victory, but only one may sit upon the throne of Mecatol Rex
                as the new masters of the galaxy.</p>
              <p>No two games of Twilight Imperium are ever identical. At the start of each galactic age, the game board
                is uniquely and strategically constructed using 51 galaxy tiles that feature everything from lush new
                planets and supernovas to asteroid fields and gravity rifts. Players are dealt a hand of these tiles and
                take turns creating the galaxy around Mecatol Rex, the capital planet seated in the center of the board.
                An ion storm may block your race from progressing through the galaxy while a fortuitously placed gravity
                rift may protect you from your closest foes. The galaxy is yours to both craft and dominate.</p>
              <p>A round of Twilight Imperium begins with players selecting one of eight strategy cards that both
                determine player order and give their owner a unique strategic action for that round. These may do
                anything from providing additional command tokens to allowing a player to control trade throughout the
                galaxy. After these roles are selected, players take turns moving their fleets from system to system,
                claiming new planets for their empire, and engaging in warfare and trade with other factions. At the end
                of a turn, players gather in a grand council to pass new laws and agendas, shaking up the game in
                unpredictable ways.</p>
              <p>After every player has passed their turn, players move up the victory track by checking to see whether
                they have completed any objectives throughout the turn and scoring them. Objectives are determined by
                setting up ten public objective cards at the start of each game, then gradually revealing them with
                every round. Every player also chooses between two random secret objectives at the start of the game,
                providing victory points achievable only by the holder of that objective. These objectives can be
                anything from researching new technologies to taking your neighbor's home system. At the end of every
                turn, a player can claim one public objective and one secret objective. As play continues, more of these
                objectives are revealed and more secret objectives are dealt out, giving players dynamically changing
                goals throughout the game. Play continues until a player reaches ten victory points.</p>
